# Custom CSS for Vivaldi Browser Tab bar auto collapse or expand on hover plus Air Theme
1. Open Vivaldi Browser
2. Type vivaldi:experiments on address bar and hit enter
3. Tick Allow CSS modifications
4. Go to TabbarAutohide.css File in this repo and copy the code
5. Open any code editor like Notepad or VSCode then paste the copied code and save it with .css extension at last of it's name (for me autohide.css) in a seperate folder (for me the folder name is Vivaldi_script)
6. Open Vivaldi and type vivaldi:settings/appearance/ in address bar and see for Custom UI Modification or simply just open settings and search for Custom UI Modification in settings search bar
7. Select the folder where the .css file located or paste the directory of the folder in bar (for me it's D:\Vivaldi_Script )
8. Restart browser. Fix width , delay , transitions etc. according to your need.

ü§èüèº Limitations:
1. It will not collapse the secondary tab bar when using Two-Level Tab Stacking. For Accordion and compact stacking it will work.
2. In some browser profiles, New tab + icon jumps upward during collapsed when both (not just one) trash can and sync tab button enabled in tab bar. When expanded + icon comes to normal position.

If anyone can fix these issues I will be grateful.
